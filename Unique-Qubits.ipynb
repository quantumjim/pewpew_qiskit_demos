    "# The Unique Properties of Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "*This workshop covers topics from the [The Unique Properties of Qubits]() section of the textbook [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](https://community.qiskit.org).*\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now go back to the first program of the workshop [The Atoms of Computation](Atoms-Computation.ipynb) and add some additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference between qubits and normal bits is that there is only one way to get an output from a normal bit: You just look at it, and see if it is `0` or `1`. For a qubit, however, there are multiple ways you can choose to do it. One is the method applied when you use a simple `measure` operation. This is called a z measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# z measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of measurement, known as an x measurement, cannot be performed quite as directly in Qiskit. Instead, it needs two lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# x measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.h(j)\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we expand upon the `meas` variable introduced in the last workshop. There it held just a single circuit. Here it will hold four: a single qubit measurement for each qubit, and for each basis. It is constructed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "meas = [{},{}]\n",
    "for j in range(2):\n",
    "    meas[j]['Z'] = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "    meas[j]['Z'].measure(j,j)\n",
    "    meas[j]['X'] = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "    meas[j]['X'].h(j)\n",
    "    meas[j]['X'].measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `meas[0]['X']` contains the circuit that measures qubit 0 in the x basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "meas[0]['X'] = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "meas[0]['X'].h(j)\n",
    "meas[0]['Z'].measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why these single qubit measurements are defined in two qubit circuits is simply so that they can be easily added together. For example, the circuit with a z measurement on qubit 0 and an x measurement on qubit 1 corresponds to the circuit `meas[0]['Z']+meas[1]['X']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice as to which measurement type to use will be controlled by the variable `basis`. The name is chosen because the type of measurement is also known as the measurement basis. We will set `basis[0]` will be `'Z'` or `'X'` depending on whether qubit 0 should be measured in basis z or x, respectively, and similarly for `basis[1]` and qubit 1. This means we can access the circuit for the measurement of qubit `j` with `meas[j][basis[j]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it obvious which basis is being used, we will display the results in different places. The output of a z measurement of qubit 1 will be displayed on pixel (1,2), as before. The output of an x measurement will instead be displayed below this at (1,4). Both will have square of dim pixels around them. And both will also be set to dim when their basis is not in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose which basis to use for each qubit, we'll use the buttons X and O. The X button will toggle between the two bases for qubit 1, and the O button will do the same for qubit 0."

    "From what we've seen so far, you'd be forgiven for thinking that qubits are just bits with some randomness bundled in. However, they are more complex than that. This becomes evident if we try to simulate them, since simulating a collection of $n$ qubits requires us to keep track of at least $2^n$ complex numbers. For around 50 qubits, this is a task that you'd need the world's biggest supercomputers for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that simulation is so difficult is that it needs to account for types of correlation that are not possible with classical bits. One example of this is explained in the [The Unique Properties of Qubits]() section of the [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](https://community.qiskit.org) textbook. There a two qubit state is used for which z measurements of both qubits will never output `'00'`, but will output the other three possibilities with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create this state here, so that we can explore it on the PewPew. We'll take a different approach to setting it up than was used in the textbook. Specifically, we'll describe the state with a so-called *state vector*, and then load this into the circuit. These vectors are a list with one entry for each possible output. For two qubits, this means a list of four elements, for `'00'`, `'01'`, `'10'` and `'11'`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements are the square roots of the probabilities for each outcome (when both qubits are measured in the z basis). Since the non-zero probabilties should be $1/3$, the corresponding element should be $0.57735$. So the state vector will be\n",
