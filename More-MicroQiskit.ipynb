    "The workshops so far have given a PewPew-based guide to the first few sections of the textbook [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](https://community.qiskit.org). This has introduced most of what MicroQiskit can do, but there are still a few features to mention.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll take the basic program from the last section and reduce it down to a single qubit. Since this frees up some buttons, we can use one to implement a new operation. Specifically, â–² will be used for `rx(pi/4,0)`."
