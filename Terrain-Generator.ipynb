It was inspired by [this work](https://medium.com/qiskit/creating-infinite-worlds-with-quantum-computing-5e998e6d21c2) on procedurally generating terrain using quantum computers, but takes a different approach."

It has to do this in a way that generates 'nice' terrain. For example, you might want it not to be too jagged, so the height of neighbouring points should be quite similar. The function will typically also use a seed. By changing the seed, you can change the terrain without needing to change the function itself\n",
