    "# The Unique Properties of Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "*This workshop is a companion to 1.1 - The Unique Properties of Qubits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now go back to the first program, of Workshop 1.1 and add some additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference between qubits and normal bits is that there is only one way to get an output from a normal bit: You just look at it, and see if it is `0` or `1`. For a qubit, however, there are multiple ways you can choose to do it. One is the method applied when you use a simple `measure` operation. This is called a z measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# z measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of measurement, known as an x measurement, cannot be performed quite as directly in Qiskit. Instead, it needs two lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# x measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.h(j)\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we expand upon the `meas` variable introduced in the last workshop. There it held just a single circuit. Here it will hold four: a single qubit measurement for each qubit, and for each basis. It is constructed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "meas = [{},{}]\n",
    "for j in range(2):\n",
    "    meas[j]['Z'] = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "    meas[j]['Z'].measure(j,j)\n",
    "    meas[j]['X'] = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "    meas[j]['X'].h(j)\n",
    "    meas[j]['X'].measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `meas[0]['X']` contains the circuit that measures qubit 0 in the x basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "meas[0]['X'] = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "meas[0]['X'].h(j)\n",
    "meas[0]['Z'].measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why these single qubit measurements are defined in two qubit circuits is simply so that they can be easily added together. For example, the circuit with a z measurement on qubit 0 and an x measurement on qubit 1 corresponds to the circuit `meas[0]['Z']+meas[1]['X']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice as to which measurement type to use will be controlled by the variable `basis`. The name is chosen because the type of measurement is also known as the measurement basis. We will set `basis[0]` will be `'Z'` or `'X'` depending on whether qubit 0 should be measured in basis z or x, respectively, and similarly for `basis[1]` and qubit 1. This means we can access the circuit for the measurement of qubit `j` with `meas[j][basis[j]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it obvious which basis is being used, we will display the results in different places. The output of a z measurement of qubit 1 will be displayed on pixel (1,2), as before. The output of an x measurement will instead be displayed below this at (1,4). Both will have square of dim pixels around them. And both will also be set to dim when their basis is not in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose which basis to use for each qubit, we'll use the buttons X and O. The X button will toggle between the two bases for qubit 1, and the O button will do the same for qubit 0."

    "\n",
    "As we have seen before, the effect of the `cx` gate on the z basis is to calculate an XOR. The XOR of the random value from qubit 0 with the `0` from qubit 1 is simply the random value from qubit 0, since the XOR of any bit value with `0` returns the same bit value. The `cx(0,1)` therefore has the effect of copying the random value over to qubit 2.\n",

    "As you should see, this state never outputs `'00'` when both qubits are measured in the z basis. However, this state happens to have other interesting properties too: For a z measurement of one qubit and and x measurement of the other, it never outputs `'11'`. Putting this another way, whenever an x measurement of one qubit outputs `1`, the other must output `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we use this information to deduce something about the results for an x measurement of each? To do this we need to make some assumptions. Some of these are assumptions that we might hardly realize we are making.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we are used to random results being due to imprecision of our own knowledge. A coin flip, for example, seems random only because don't know precisely where on the coin our thumb strikes, or with what force, or the pressure and movement of the air through which the coin travels, and so on. If we did know these things, we could predict the results with certainty. The same is true for the internal state of random number generators in our computers. It is therefore natural to assume that qubits similarly possess some 'hidden variables', which we could use to predict results if only we knew them. This would mean that, whenever we prepare a qubit in some state, we are actually randomly generating some set of hidden variables in a way that depends on that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we typically assume that objects are independent from our observations of them. Even more so, we assume that one object is independent of how we observe another independent object. Combined with our our assumption of hidden variables, we would assume that the results for each qubit can be deduced using only the knowledge of how that qubit is being measured, along with the values of its hidden variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with these assumptions, let us consider whether it is possible to get an outcome of `'11'` for an x measurement of both qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that an outcome of `1` for an x measurement of one qubit implies that a z measurement for the other must output a `0`. That would imply that whatever value for the hidden variables of the qubits that cause the outcome of `'11'` for x measurements, would cause an outcome of `'00'` for z measurements. We have seen that the latter never occurs, and so can conclude that the particular state we initialize never has hidden variables that would allow such an outcome. This means that an outcome of `'11'` for x measurements cannot occur either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it out, and see how wrong we are!\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that the outcome of `'11'` for x measurements is indeed possible for this state. Our assumptions must therefore be incorrect. Specifically, we can either give up the idea that the randomness is dependent on hidden variables, or the idea that the results we get from each qubit is independent of how we choose to measure the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "After many experiments over the last few decades, we have concluded that it is the assumption of hidden variables that must be abandoned. The randomness of qubits is therefore truly random. A qubit certain to output a `0` for a x measurement, for example, has truly no idea of the outcome it would give for an x measurement. Any certainty we have for the outcome of one measurement type implies uncertainty for the output of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly why the logic we used above did not hold. We took a case where we knew the outcome of both qubits for an x measurement, and used that to infer what would have happened if one of the qubits had a z measurement. This meant we knew the outcomes of both measurement types with certainty, and so we were wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviour we see here shows how qubits are intrinsically different from any variable in normal programming. If we created two ways of extracting a bit value from an integer, or a list, or some other standard object, we could never prepare two such objects that were correlated in the same way as these qubits. Indeed, when we simulate a group of qubits, we cannot do so by creating a separate object to handle to simulation of each. If we could, these could simply be used as our hidden variables when describing real qubits. Instead, we need to create a single object to handle the entire simulation, which must be able to account for every possible combination of measurements. It is precisely because of this reason that quantum computers become exponentially hard to simulate as the number of qubits increases. And that is why we know that they have the potential to do things that no normal computer can reproduce. We just need to harness the counterintuive effects, such as the one we've seen here, to solve our computational problems."
