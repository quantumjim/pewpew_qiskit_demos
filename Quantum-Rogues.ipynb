    "[*Quantum Rogues*](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-europe-19/issues/5) was a game created at the [Qiskit Camp Europe](https://qiskit.camp/europe/) hackathon in September 2019. In this notebook we create a new game, which takes the basic idea of the original *Quantum Rogues* and ports it to the PewPew."
