    "*This demo is a companion to 1.1 - The Atoms of Computation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we look at the simplest and, arguably, least quantum of the gates available to us: `x` and `cx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will slightly modify the program from the last demo. In that case, a circuit was created that gave random outcomes. In this case, we just start with a blank circuit `qc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "qc = QuantumCircuit(2,2) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also create another circuit, `meas`, which simply contains the measurements required to extract an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "meas = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "meas.measure(0,0)\n",
    "meas.measure(1,1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit we run is then the combination of these circuits, `qc+meas`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "execute(qc+meas,shots=1,get='memory')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are running a circuit which immediately extracts an output, without doing anything before the measurement. Since qubits are always initialized in the state $|0\\rangle$, which is the notation use to describe the state that gives the output `0` with certainty, the output of this two qubit circuit will be `'00'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next modification is to look for player inputs. Specifically, the ▲ button is used to add an `x` gate on qubit 0, and the ▼ button adds an `x` to qubit 1. The effect of the `x` is to flip $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$ and vice-versa. By pressing these buttons, we therefore manually change the output between the four possible outputs. A variable `old_keys` is used to make sure an `x` gate is only added when the button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Qiskit labels bits from right to left. So the output of qubit 0 will be displayed in the left square.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the emulator embedded in these notebooks, open and run the [controller notebook](controller.ipynb). This will give you a controller with which you can interact with the process on screen. Make sure to run this before any PewPew emulation processes are running."

    "In the above we are just using qubits to store bit values, and using the `x` gate to flip those values between `'0'` and `'1'`. Now it's time to try out a little computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1.1 - The Atoms of Computation](../ch0/1.1.ipynb), we saw how to create a half adder using the `cx` and `ccx` gates. The `cx` calculated the least significant digit fo the answer, which is just the XOR of the inputs. The `ccx` calculated the most significant digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Aether only gives us two qubits to play with, and the `ccx` requires three, we won't be fully able to reproduce the half adder here. However, we can at least use the `cx` to calculate the XOR of the two bit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by simply adding a `cx` into the circuit before measurement. Whichever qubit is the 'target' of this gate (the second qubit specified in its argument) will have its output essentially overwritten with result of the XOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we'll add the `cx` gate will be to make a circuit just containing a `cx`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cnot = QuantumCircuit(2,2)\n",
    "cnot.cx(0,1)\n",
    "```\n",

    "We can then add it in before the measurement when we calculate the XOR.\n",

    "xor = m[0][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that Python numbers the characters in a string from left to right, whereas Qiskit labels bits in a bit string from right to left. So for the four possible output values contained in `m[0]` (`'00'`, `'01'`, `'10'` and `'11'`), it is the bit value on the left that describes the output of qubit 0 and the bit value on the right that describes that for qubit 1. This means `m[0][1]` is the output for qubit 0, and `m[0][0]` is that for qubit 1 is that for qubit 1. Since the `cx` we use has qubit 1 as the target, the XOR result will be found at `m[0][0]`.\n",
