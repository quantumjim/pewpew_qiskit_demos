    "# Introduction to the PewPew\n",
    "\n",
    "*This workshop covers topics from the [Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks]()  section of the textbook [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](https://community.qiskit.org).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PewPew](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a handheld games console with 6 buttons and 64 pixels. It provides a perfect environment for people to get their first taste of programming or game design. In these workshops we will also use it to get people started with quantum computing.\n",

    "### How to run PewPew programs\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cells in this notebook are all standalone programs. To run them, pick one of the following three options.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run on an actual PewPew by connecting it to your computer, and then copying the program into the `main.py` file on the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run it in conjugation with the Pygame-based emulator for the PewPew.  You can do this by using a web-hosted service such as [this one](https://repl.it/@quantum_jim/pewpewtutorials) (Note that this is an external site, unaffiliated with Qiskit or IBM). You could also download all the files there, copy programs into the `main.py` file and run them on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simply run the cells in this notebook to use a Matplotlib-based emulator. You'll also need to open and run [this notebook](controller.ipynb) to get the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the third option, start by firing up the matplotlib magic."
